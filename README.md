This is a project in which the user is at a starship fueling station in the Star Wars universe.
The user is greeted by D4C, the station's protocol droid and can interact with the program in
one of three ways:
    1) as a CLIENT: The user will be prompted to give details about themselves and their ship.
                    Data provided by the user and calculated by D4C will be stored in the
                    "clientData.txt" file in project's main directory.
    2) as EMPLOYEE: D4C will ask the user for a password. The password is "PASSWORD".
                    The user will be given details by D4C about the station's currect prices.
    3) as ISB:      The user can tell D4C they're from the ISB, even thought D4C will not 
                    provide ISB as an option. The ISB access option also requires a password.
                    The password is "o2@Ug*221H". Once the password has been verified by D4C,
                    the user will gain access to all the data of all previous clients.
